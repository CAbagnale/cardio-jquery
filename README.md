# Cardio App (jQuery)

## Getting Started

So far, I setup two groups of diagnoses. Each group has a set of keywords associated with it. (both stored in store2.js)
So if you search a keyword associated with group 1, group 1 of diagnoses are displayed. 
keywords to search for group 1: 'keyword', 'key', & 'word'
keywords to search for group 2: 'heart', 'mi', & 'attack'
searching anything else won't return results.

Let me know if this is what you're going for or not.
